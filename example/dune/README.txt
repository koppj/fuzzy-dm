Please note that arXiv does not support providing ancillary files as tar files; there is no
way to prevent the arXiv file processing system from automatically extracting from the tar file.
The extracted version of the the ancillary files can be found in anc_files/ where
you will find three subdirectories: DUNE_Flux, DUNE_GDML, and DUNE_GLoBES_Configs, corresponding
to the three ancillary packages.

You may download individual files (may be useful for flux or GDML files) or you may download the
entire source package as a gzipped tar file. This is recommended for the GLoBES configuration as
you will want to preserve the directory structure in order to run the GLoBES configurations.
